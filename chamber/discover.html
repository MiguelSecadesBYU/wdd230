                            The current church, built between 1945 and 1955 after the destruction of the previous 15th-century building during the Civil War, follows a project by the architects 
                            Francisco and Federico Somolinos. Originally from Gothic style and with numerous later additions, it is currently in a historicist style inspired by the Asturian Romanesque 
                            and pre-Romanesque.

                            The bronze work represents a woman, with curly hair and a dress clinging to her body by the wind, with her hand outstretched, in goodbye, and her gaze towards the sea, the place 
                            through which her children disappeared, waiting for her return while she suffers. exposed to the elements of the Cantabrian Sea.

                            Located on the Poniente Beach promenade, without leaving the town of Gij√≥n, El Acuario, inaugurated on June 10, 2006, continues to increase its fame and its powerful appeal as a must-see.

                            The first part of it is dedicated exclusively to the Cantabrian River. Very well set, simulating a rock, with the sound of water accompanying everywhere. Then we access the Cantabrian Coast, 
                            where an aquarium stands out in which we can put our heads and admire the movement of the fish from a privileged position.

                            We arrive at two zones of the Atlantic Ocean: the temperate and the Caribbean, the domains of ‚Äúthe great swimmers‚Äù, as explained in the panels. In the temperate ocean, inside a huge and unique 
                            aquarium of 1.3 million liters of water and six meters deep, we see South Atlantic bull sharks roam at will, and gray ones too.

                            The journey soon takes us further south, to Cape Horn, the home of the peculiar Magellanic penguins.

                            The facility also has a Species Recovery Center, which aims to make the center a national benchmark, a pioneer in the hard work of recovery and conservation of marine fauna.
