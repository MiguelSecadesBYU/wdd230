                        Because they are located in one of the most beautiful places in the city and are ideal for having a postcard of the city, those known as "big letters" 
                        soon became the new emblem of the city for all visitors.

                        of the North Atlantic. It is the first Botanical Garden in the northwest of the Iberian Peninsula and stands out for its approach, modern and 
                        non-generalist, based on specialized collections of flora. Its lines of work focus on the promotion of activities and services, in the scientific, 
                        educational, tourist, and cultural fields, aimed at the conservation and dissemination of plant and natural heritage.

                        Initially conceived as a mining orphanage and transformed at the time of its construction into a Labor University, Luis Moya's building was conceived 
                        as a great self-sufficient ideal city closed in on itself, which even had a 100-hectare farm and was prepared for train generations of children of workers 
                        as highly qualified professionals.

                        The Festival program includes an apple and cider market, the Guinness Record challenge for simultaneous pouring that is beaten year after year, a pourer contest,

                    <p>
                        The church of San Pedro is a Catholic temple located in the city of Gijón (Principality of Asturias, Spain), of which it is one of its most representative buildings. 
                        It is located in Campo Valdés, at one end of the beach of San Lorenzo and the foot of the Cimadevilla neighborhood. It was the only parish church in the town until 1893. 
                        The current church, built between 1945 and 1955 after the destruction of the previous 15th-century building during the Civil War, follows a project by the architects 
                        Francisco and Federico Somolinos. Originally from Gothic style and with numerous later additions, it is currently in a historicist style inspired by the Asturian Romanesque 
                        and pre-Romanesque.

                    <p>
                        The emigrant's mother is a sculpture by the Spanish sculptor Ramón Muriedas Mazorra located on the Gijón seafront promenade, in homage to Asturian emigration around the world 
                        and the first sculptural work in modern language located in the Atlantic city.

                        The bronze work represents a woman, with curly hair and a dress clinging to her body by the wind, with her hand outstretched, in goodbye, and her gaze towards the sea, the place 
                        through which her children disappeared, waiting for her return while she suffers. exposed to the elements of the Cantabrian Sea.

                        Located on the Poniente Beach promenade, without leaving the town of Gijón, El Acuario, inaugurated on June 10, 2006, continues to increase its fame and its powerful appeal as a must-see.

                    <p>
                        The first part of it is dedicated exclusively to the Cantabrian River. Very well set, simulating a rock, with the sound of water accompanying everywhere. Then we access the Cantabrian Coast, 
                        where an aquarium stands out in which we can put our heads and admire the movement of the fish from a privileged position.

                    <p>
                        We arrive at two zones of the Atlantic Ocean: the temperate and the Caribbean, the domains of “the great swimmers”, as explained in the panels. In the temperate ocean, inside a huge and unique 
                        aquarium of 1.3 million liters of water and six meters deep, we see South Atlantic bull sharks roam at will, and gray ones too.

                    <p>
                        The journey soon takes us further south, to Cape Horn, the home of the peculiar Magellanic penguins.

                    <p>
                        The facility also has a Species Recovery Center, which aims to make the center a national benchmark, a pioneer in the hard work of recovery and conservation of marine fauna.
